<p>By the end of reading this article, if you follow all the instructions, you will have made the final decision.

Just by the fact that you are here reading this, I know you have spent a lot of time into researching and pondering. It's time to stop.

Switching between game engines is no big deal. The real work, 99.99% of the work, is in actually going through the process of making games which will make you acquire the experience and knowledge of actually making games. That's what actually matters.

It's the same thing with 3D modelling and programming. Doesn't matter if you start off in Blender or Maya, doesn't matter if you pick JavaScript or Python.

If you picked JavaScript, after putting time into learning and actually making stuff with it you'll know the concepts of programming. And then you can easily pick up Python within a matter of days, 90% of it is just the same concepts with different vocabulary.

If you picked Blender.... (It's the same story as before, replace JavaScript with Blender and Python with Maya)

It's about learning programming, learning programming languages is easy.

It's about learning 3d modeling, learning 3d modeling applications is easy.

**Learning an engine is easy. Learning how to make games is hard.**

---

Doesn't matter which one you choose. Just pick one and start making. And then put your head down and work, I don't want you to invest a single moment of time into comparing game engines until at least putting out a couple of finished projects.

So what I want you to do is set a timer for 5 minutes, make a list of the pros and cons of both, and fucking decide. 

----

5 minutes have passed and you've still not arrived at a decision?

Seriously, just flip a coin. Do it.

Now go make games, don't even think about switching game engines until you've put out a couple of finished projects. That's it. You don't need to read this comment any further. Close this tab.

Still here? What.. the coin landed on the edge? 


Okay, I'll make the decision for you.   ^(^Unity)

Now go make.</p>
