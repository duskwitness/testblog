        <h1>Unity or Unreal? Which game development engine should I choose?</h1>

        <p>By the end of reading this article, if you follow all the instructions, you will have made the final decision.</p>

        <p>Just by the fact that you are here reading this, I know you have spent a lot of time into researching and pondering. 
            It's time to stop.</p>

        <p>-----</p>

        <p>Switching between game engines is no big deal. The real work, 99.99% of the work, is in actually going through the 
            process of making games which will make you acquire the experience and knowledge of actually making games. 
            That's what actually matters.</p>

        <p>It's the same thing with 3D modelling and programming. Doesn't matter if you start off in Blender or Maya,
             doesn't matter if you pick JavaScript or Python.</p>

        <p>If you picked JavaScript, after putting time into learning and actually making stuff with it you'll know the concepts
             of programming. And then you can easily pick up Python within a matter of days, 90% of it is just the same concepts
              with different vocabulary.</p>

        <p>If you picked Blender.... (It's the same story as before, replace JavaScript with Blender and Python with Maya)</p>

        <p>-----</p>

        <p>It's about learning programming, learning programming languages is easy.</p>

        <p>It's about learning 3d modeling, learning 3d modeling applications is easy.</p>

        <p>**Learning an engine is easy. Learning how to make games is hard.**</p>

        <p>---</p>

        <p>Doesn't matter which one you choose. Just pick one and start making. And then put your head down and work, 
            I don't want you to invest a single moment of time into comparing game engines until at least putting out a 
            couple of finished projects.</p>

        <p>[Start fucking executing](https://youtu.be/Q5jiifErFEE) (watch this)</p>

        <p>----</p>

        <p>So what I want you to do is set a timer for 5 minutes, make a list of the pros and cons of both, and fucking decide.</p>

        <p>----</p>

        <p>5 minutes have passed and you've still not arrived at a decision?</p>
        <p>Seriously, just flip a coin. Do it.</p>
        <p>Now go make games, don't even think about switching game engines until you've put out a couple of finished projects. 
            That's it. You don't need to read this comment any further. Close this tab.</p>

        <p>----</p>

        <p>Still here? What.. the coin landed on the edge? </p>
        <p>Okay, I'll make the decision for you. Unity.</p>
        <p>Now go make.</p>
